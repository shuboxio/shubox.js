# Phase 3: Add Retry Mechanisms - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Phase 3 of the error handling improvements focused on implementing automatic retry logic for S3 upload failures. This ensures that transient network issues and server errors don't result in complete upload failures, significantly improving the reliability of the library.

## What Was Implemented

### 3.1 Signature Fetch Retry ✅

**Status:** Already implemented in Phase 1
- The signature fetch endpoint already uses `fetchWithRetry` utility
- Configured for 3 retries with exponential backoff
- Properly handles 5xx server errors and network failures
- Does not retry 4xx client errors

**Location:** `src/shubox/shubox_callbacks.ts:78-98`

### 3.2 S3 Upload Retry ✅

**Status:** Newly implemented in Phase 3

#### Research Findings

Dropzone.js does not provide automatic retry mechanisms for standard (non-chunked) uploads. The library only offers retry support for chunked uploads via `retryChunks` and `retryChunksLimit` options.

Since Shubox uses direct S3 uploads with pre-signed URLs (not chunked), we implemented retry logic at the Shubox level.

#### Implementation Details

**1. Retry Configuration Options**

Added new options to `ShuboxOptions` interface:
```typescript
interface ShuboxOptions {
  // Error handling options
  timeout?: number;           // Default: 60000ms (60 seconds) for uploads
  retryAttempts?: number;     // Default: 3
  onRetry?: (attempt: number, error: Error, file: ShuboxDropzoneFile) => void;
}
```

**2. File Tracking**

Extended `ShuboxDropzoneFile` interface to track retry attempts:
```typescript
interface ShuboxDropzoneFile {
  _shuboxRetryCount?: number;  // Tracks number of retry attempts
}
```

**3. Error Classification**

Implemented `_isRecoverableUploadError()` method to determine which errors should trigger retries:

**Recoverable Errors (will retry):**
- NetworkError instances
- Timeout errors
- Connection failures
- 5xx server errors (500-599)
- 429 rate limit errors
- Service unavailable (503)
- Bad gateway (502)
- Gateway timeout (504)

**Non-recoverable Errors (will NOT retry):**
- 4xx client errors (400-499)
- 401 Unauthorized
- 403 Forbidden
- 404 Not Found
- Validation errors
- File type rejections

**4. Retry Logic**

Enhanced the `error` callback in `ShuboxCallbacks.toHash()`:
- Initializes retry count on first error
- Checks if error is recoverable
- Uses exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s delays
- Resets file status to `Dropzone.QUEUED` to allow retry
- Calls `onRetry` callback if provided
- Schedules retry using `setTimeout`
- After max retries exhausted, calls error handler

**5. Timeout Configuration**

Added timeout to Dropzone configuration:
```typescript
const dropzoneOptions: Dropzone.DropzoneOptions = {
  // ... other options
  timeout: this.options.timeout || 60000,  // Default 60s for uploads
};
```

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation

- ✅ 401, 403, 404 rejection
- ✅ Validation error rejection

### Retry Logic Tests (11 tests)
- ✅ Retry on recoverable errors
- ✅ Exponential backoff timing (1s, 2s, 4s)
- ✅ Stop after max attempts

### Configuration Tests (2 tests)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (uses defaults)
```javascript
new Shubox('.upload', {
  key: 'your-key',
  error: (file, error) => {
    console.error('Upload failed after retries:', error);
  }
});
// Automatically retries up to 3 times with 60s timeout
```

### Custom Configuration
```javascript
new Shubox('.upload', {
  key: 'your-key',
  retryAttempts: 5,           // Try up to 5 times
  timeout: 120000,            // 2 minute timeout for large files
  onRetry: (attempt, error, file) => {
    console.log(`Retry attempt ${attempt} for ${file.name}`);
    showUserMessage(`Retrying upload... (attempt ${attempt})`);
  },
  error: (file, error) => {
    console.error('Upload failed after all retries:', error);
    showUserError(`Failed to upload ${file.name}`);
  }
});
```

### Monitoring Retries
```javascript
new Shubox('.upload', {
  key: 'your-key',
  onRetry: (attempt, error, file) => {
    // Log to analytics
    analytics.track('upload_retry', {
      fileName: file.name,
      attempt: attempt,
      errorType: error.constructor.name,
      errorMessage: error.message
    });

    // Update UI
    updateProgressBar(file, `Retrying... (${attempt}/3)`);
  },
  error: (file, error) => {
    if (error.recoverable) {
      showRetryButton(file);
    }
  }
});
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability:** Transient network issues no longer result in complete failures
2. **Better UX:** Users don't need to manually retry uploads for temporary problems
3. **Reduced Support Load:** Automatic retries handle most network hiccups without user intervention
4. **Smart Retry Logic:** Only retries errors that make sense (5xx, timeouts), not user errors (4xx)
5. **Configurable:** Developers can adjust retry behavior based on their needs
6. **Observable:** onRetry callback allows monitoring and custom UI feedback

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible** - All changes are additive:
- Existing code works without any modifications
- New options are optional with sensible defaults
- Retry behavior activates automatically for recoverable errors
- No breaking changes to public API

## Performance Considerations

- **Exponential Backoff:** Prevents overwhelming servers during outages
- **Smart Classification:** Doesn't waste retries on permanent errors
- **Timeout Protection:** Prevents indefinite hanging on slow connections
- **Resource Cleanup:** Properly manages DOM classes and state during retries

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for Phase 3)

These were considered but deferred:
- **Chunked Upload Support:** Large file resume capability using Dropzone's chunking
- **Progressive Retry UI:** Built-in visual feedback for retry attempts
- **Retry Queue:** Batch retry logic for multiple files
- **Custom Retry Strategies:** Allow users to provide custom backoff algorithms

## Testing Results

All 72 tests pass (including 23 new retry tests):
```
✓ tests/shubox/variant.test.ts  (6 tests)
✓ tests/shubox/upload_retry.test.ts  (23 tests)  ← New
✓ tests/shubox.test.ts  (6 tests)
✓ tests/shubox/fetch_with_retry.test.ts  (17 tests)
✓ tests/shubox/errors.test.ts  (17 tests)
✓ tests/shubox/filename_from_file.test.ts  (3 tests)
```

## Conclusion

Phase 3 successfully implements comprehensive retry mechanisms for S3 uploads, completing the error handling improvements outlined in issue #440. The implementation:

- ✅ Automatically retries recoverable upload failures
- ✅ Uses smart exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming services
- ✅ Provides configurable retry behavior
- ✅ Includes comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Maintains full backward compatibility
- ✅ Improves overall library reliability

The retry system significantly enhances the user experience by handling transient failures gracefully, reducing the need for manual intervention when uploads fail due to temporary network or server issues.
